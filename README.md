Cracking the coding interview

# Chapter 1 - arrays and strings

## Task 1-1
Implement algorithm which check if in string there are only unique chars.

## Task 1-3
Implement algorithm which check if one char array is permuted of another.

## Task 1-4
Implement algorithm which replace all spaces in the char array to %20'.<br>
Example<br>
Input  "I LIKE MY DOG      "<br>
Output "I%20LIKE%20MY%20DOG"

##Task 1-5

Implement compress method which count number of repeated chars. 
If compressed string is not shorter than input than the input should be returned.<br>
Example:<br>
input = "aabcccccaaa"; <br>
String expected="a2b1c5a3";
